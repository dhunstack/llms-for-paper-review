Summary of the Paper:
This paper investigates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) trained solely on text can learn to map words to grounded conceptual spaces, despite never being explicitly trained on such groundings.
The authors focus on color and direction domains, representing the grounded spaces as text (e.g.
RGB values for colors, 2D matrices for directions).
They prompt LLMs with a few examples of groundings (e.g.
the word "red" mapped to the RGB code for red) and test if the models can generalize to unseen instances and unseen but related concepts.
Crucially, they test the models on "rotated" conceptual spaces to control for memorization.
The key findings are:
1) The largest model tested (GPT-3 with 175B parameters) can learn to ground words to conceptual spaces to a significant degree, while smaller models struggle.
2) The models generalize to unseen instances in the original and rotated spaces, but not in random unstructured spaces, suggesting they are not merely memorizing.
3) To some extent, the models can generalize to unseen but related concepts (e.g.
grounding "blue" after being shown how to ground "red").
4) Analysis of model errors shows the large model tends to predict incorrect but semantically related concepts.
Strengths and Weaknesses:
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the fundamental question of whether LLMs can learn grounded meaning solely from text, which has significant implications for language understanding.
- The experimental design carefully controls for memorization using rotated conceptual spaces.
- Testing for generalization to unseen concepts is a strong evaluation of the models' ability to learn conceptual structure.
- The error analysis provides useful insights into the models' failures and successes.
Weaknesses:
- The domains tested (colors and directions) are fairly simple and restricted to text representations.
It's unclear if the findings would generalize to more complex grounded concepts.
- There is no comparison to multimodal models trained on both text and perceptual data, to assess the gap between pure language models and grounded models.
- More insight into what enables the largest model to succeed (e.g.
analyzing its representations) would strengthen the explanatory power of the work.
Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:
The paper is clearly written and the methodology is described in enough detail to enable reproducibility.
The research question is novel and the results are significant, shedding light on the grounding capabilities of LLMs.
The experiments are carefully designed and analyzed.
The domains tested are simple but the paper provides a strong proof of concept.
Summary of the Review:
This paper provides an insightful and well-executed investigation into the ability of language models to learn grounded meaning solely from text.
The key finding that very large LLMs can learn to map words to conceptual spaces, and generalize to some extent to unseen concepts, is significant and novel.
The experiments are rigorous, controlling for memorization and testing generalization.
The paper opens up an exciting direction for building grounded language understanding from the rich conceptual structure captured by large LLMs.
The main limitation is that the tested domains are narrow, so the generality of the findings to more complex concepts remains an open question.
Overall, this is an important contribution that advances our understanding of the grounding capabilities of language models.
