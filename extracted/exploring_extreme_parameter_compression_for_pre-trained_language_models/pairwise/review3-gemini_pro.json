        "rationale": "Both points focus on knowledge distillation and its impact. Review A mentions a large accuracy drop due to knowledge distillation fine-tuning, while Review B highlights the dependency on knowledge distillation to mitigate weight approximation errors and concerns about its applicability to other models or tasks.",
