Review A suggests that Tucker decomposition is an incremental extension lacking novelty, while Review B requests a deeper theoretical explanation for its effectiveness in this context.",

        "rationale": "Both points address limitations of the proposed methodâ€™s structure. Review A suggests a potential bias introduced by the fixed structure of Tucker decomposition, while Review B discusses concerns about the scalability and reliability of the decomposed sets, which is also affected by structural choices.",
