Summary of the Paper:
This paper proposes IAPEK (Instance-level Adaptive Propulsion of External Knowledge), a method to selectively augment pre-trained language models (PTLMs) with external knowledge only when necessary.
The authors introduce a novel metric called Thrust which scores each instance based on whether the PTLM needs external knowledge to answer it.
Thrust leverages the distribution of training instances in the PTLM's representation space.
Experiments on a range of classification and QA tasks show that using Thrust to adaptively inject external knowledge leads to significant performance improvements while being more cost-efficient than always using external knowledge.
The findings shed light on how to effectively use knowledge in real-world applications of LMs with limited knowledge-seeking budgets.
Strengths and Weaknesses:
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem - how to efficiently and effectively augment PTLMs with external knowledge only when needed.
This is critical for real-world applications.
- The Thrust metric is simple yet effective at identifying instances that require external knowledge.
It is a novel contribution.
- Extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the IAPEK approach using Thrust, leading to performance gains while being more cost-efficient.
- The work provides valuable insights into the judicious use of external knowledge in LMs to balance performance and efficiency.
Weaknesses:
- While the Thrust metric is evaluated on various tasks and datasets, it would be good to see even more comprehensive experiments, e.g.
on additional benchmarks and knowledge sources.
- Some details on Thrust could be explained further, e.g.
how hyperparameters like number of clusters are chosen, runtime cost of computing Thrust.
- Qualitative examples illustrating when Thrust decides to seek external knowledge would provide additional insights.
- Theoretical analysis or justification of why Thrust is an effective scoring function would strengthen the work.
Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:
The paper is clearly written and the proposed method is well-explained.
The overall quality of research is high, with the authors performing comprehensive experiments.
The Thrust metric and overall IAPEK approach are novel contributions.
Key details are provided to allow reproducibility, though the code is not open-sourced yet (but the authors intend to release it).
Summary of the Review:
This paper makes a valuable contribution by proposing IAPEK and the Thrust metric to adaptively augment LMs with external knowledge.
Thrust effectively identifies instances needing knowledge, enabling IAPEK to outperform baselines while being more efficient.
Extensive experiments highlight the benefits.
Some additional details, analysis and even more comprehensive evaluation could further strengthen this already solid work.
Overall, this paper proposes a novel and impactful method to address an important problem.
