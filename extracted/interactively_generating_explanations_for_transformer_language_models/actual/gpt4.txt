Summary of the Paper:
This paper introduces Prototypical-Transformer Explanation (Proto-Trex) Networks, a novel approach to enhancing the interpretability of transformer language models (LMs) through prototype networks incorporated directly into the model architecture.
Proto-Trex Networks provide case-based reasoning explanations by outputting prototypical examples for specific model predictions, aiming to increase the model's transparency and reduce bias.
The paper also presents an interactive prototype learning setup, iProto-Trex, allowing user feedback to refine and improve the model's explanations and decisions.
Experimental results show that Proto-Trex networks perform comparably to non-interpretable baselines while offering significant improvements in interpretability and user trust.
