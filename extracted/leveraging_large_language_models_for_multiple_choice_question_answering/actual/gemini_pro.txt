Summary of the Paper:
This paper investigates the effectiveness of different prompting methods for utilizing large language models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks.
It argues that the traditional cloze prompting (CP) approach, where the LLM independently scores each answer option, has limitations.
The paper proposes multiple-choice prompting (MCP) as an alternative, where the LLM receives the question and all answer options jointly.
The authors introduce the concept of multiple-choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability, which is crucial for LLMs to benefit from MCP.
They demonstrate that Codex, an LLM with high MCSB ability, significantly outperforms CP across 20 diverse datasets when prompted with MCP, often approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
Strengths and Weaknesses:
Strengths:
Compelling argument for MCP: The paper clearly outlines the limitations of CP and presents a strong case for the advantages of MCP in MCQA tasks.
Extensive evaluation: The authors evaluate their approach on a wide range of 20 datasets, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of MCP across different domains and question types.
Significant performance improvement: Codex with MCP achieves substantial accuracy gains over CP and even surpasses previous SOTA results on several datasets.
This suggests that LLMs have been underestimated for MCQA due to suboptimal prompting methods.
Addresses dataset leakage concerns: The authors acknowledge the potential issue of dataset leakage and provide arguments and evidence suggesting that it does not significantly impact their results.
Weaknesses:
Limited model analysis: While the paper shows that Codex performs well with MCP, it does not delve deeper into the specific characteristics of LLMs that contribute to high MCSB ability. Further analysis could provide valuable insights for future model development.
Prompt engineering not explored: The authors intentionally avoid prompt engineering to ensure a fair comparison between CP and MCP.
However, exploring prompt engineering techniques for MCP could potentially lead to further performance improvements.
Computational cost: While MCP is more efficient than CP per question, the evaluation process across numerous datasets and prompting methods remains computationally expensive. This highlights the need for more efficient evaluation strategies for large-scale LLM research.
Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the research question, methodology, and findings.
The research is of high quality, with a comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets.
The concept of MCSB and the use of MCP for LLMs in MCQA are novel contributions.
The authors provide code and details to facilitate the reproduction of their experiments.
Summary of the Review:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM research by demonstrating the effectiveness of multiple-choice prompting for MCQA tasks.
The extensive evaluation and substantial performance improvements suggest that MCP can unlock the potential of LLMs for MCQA and contribute to the vision of LLMs as foundation models.
Further investigation into the factors influencing MCSB ability and exploration of prompt engineering for MCP are promising directions for future work.
