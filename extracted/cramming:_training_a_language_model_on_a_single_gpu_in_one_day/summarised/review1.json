        "verbatim": "Similar studies were conducted on a single node with 8 GPUs as noted by the authors. Though that setup had considerably more computational resources the total volume of computation was still a fraction of the amount used by many large research institutions. In light of that work, the scenario presented in this paper may seem somewhat derivative and only marginally interesting."
