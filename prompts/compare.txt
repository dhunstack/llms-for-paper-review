Your task is to carefully analyze and accurately match the key concerns raised in two reviews, ensuring a strong correspondence between the matched points. Examine the verbatim closely. 

=====Review A: 
‘‘‘ 
<JSON extracted comments for Review A from previous step> 
‘‘‘ 

=====Review B: 
‘‘‘ 
<JSON extracted comments for Review B from previous step> 
‘‘‘ 

Please follow the example JSON format below for matching points. For instance, if point 1 from review A is nearly identical to point 2 from review B, it should look like this: 

{{ 
    "A1-B2": {{"rationale": "<explain why A1 and B2 are nearly identical>", "similarity": "<5-10, only an integer>"}}, 
    ... 
}} 


Note that you should only match points with a significant degree of similarity in their concerns. Refrain from matching points with only superficial similarities or weak connections. For each matched pair, rate the similarity on a scale of 5-10. 

5. Somewhat Related: Points address similar themes but from different angles. 
6. Moderately Related: Points share a common theme but with different perspectives or suggestions. 
7. Strongly Related: Points are largely aligned but differ in some details or nuances. 
8. Very Strongly Related: Points offer similar suggestions or concerns, with slight differences. 
9. Almost Identical: Points are nearly the same, with minor differences in wording or presentation. 
10. Identical: Points are exactly the same in terms of concerns, suggestions, or praises. 


If no match is found, output an empty JSON object. Provide your output as JSON only.
